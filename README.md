You can see it running at my portfolio <http://rraparicio.com>

## Installation

Replace the `content`, `public` & `templates` folders from the default stacey installation with the folders from this repo.

## Usage

This template was done to be part as a portfolio of different projects. The index page is exactly as the page of the project's folder.

Each project can have:

-	A video embedded 
-	Gallery of images. 
-	Small content (preview of the content)

Each project need to have:

-	Content
-	Tags
-	Title
-	Subtitle

It also has an about page, with possibility to add links to twitter, email and LinkedIn.

The blog URL of the navigation has to be changed (or removed) from the partial "navigation.html".

Add your code and domain to Google Analytics script in each page template, or remove the script.

The code section is equal to the project, but the elements goes directly to an external webpage.

Check the content to understand the complete work of the template.
